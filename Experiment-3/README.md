## THEORY
Linear convolution is a mathematical operation used to combine two signals to produce a third signal. 
It's a fundamental operation in signal processing and systems theory. <br>
Mathematical Definition: <br>
Given two signals, x(t) and h(t), their linear convolution is defined as: <br>
                           y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = ∫𝐱(𝛕)𝐡(𝐭 − 𝛕) 𝐝𝛕 <br>
Applications: <br>
• Filtering: Convolution is used to filter signals, removing unwanted frequencies or noise. <br>
• System Analysis: The impulse response of a system completely characterizes its behaviour, and 
convolution can be used to determine the output of the system given a known input. <br>
• Image Processing: Convolution is used for tasks like edge detection, blurring, and sharpening 
images.
