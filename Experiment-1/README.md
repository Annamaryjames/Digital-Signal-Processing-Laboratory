## THEORY

1. Unit Impulse Signal:  <br>
• A signal that is zero everywhere except at one point, typically at t=0 where its value is 1.  <br>
• Mathematically δ(t) ={∞; 𝒕 = 𝟎&𝟎; 𝒕 ≠ 𝟎}  <br>
 
2. Unit Step Signal:   <br>
• A signal that is zero for all negative time values and one for positive time values.  <br>
• Mathematically u(t) ={𝟏; 𝒕 ≥ 𝟎&𝟎; 𝒕 < 𝟎}  <br>
 
3. Ramp Signal:  <br>
• A signal that increases linearly with time.  <br>
• Mathematically r(t) ={ 𝒕; 𝒕 ≥ 𝟎&𝟎; 𝒕 < 𝟎}  <br>
 
4. Sine Signal:  <br>
• A continuous periodic signal. It oscillates smoothly between -1 and 1.  <br>
• Mathematically: y(t)=Asin(2πft)  <br>
 
5. Cosine Signal:  <br>
• A continuous periodic signal like the sine wave but phase-shifted by π\2.  <br>
• Mathematically: y(t)=Acos(2πft)  <br>
 
6.  Square wave-bipolar:  <br>
• A pulse signal that alternates between positive and negative values, usually rectangular in 
shape. It switches between two constant levels (e.g., -1 and 1)  for a defined duration.  <br>
• Mathematically p(t) = A for |t| ≤ τ/2, p(t) = 0 otherwise  <br>
 
7. Square wave-unipolar:  <br>
• A pulse signal that alternates between zero and a positive value. It remains at zero for a specified 
duration and then jumps to a positive constant level (e.g., 0 and 1).  <br>
• Mathematically p(t) = A for |t| ≤ τ/2, p(t) = 0 otherwise (assuming A is positive)  <br>
 
8. Exponential Signal:  <br>
• A signal that increases or decreases exponentially with time. The rate of growth or decay is 
determined by the constant a.  <br>
• Mathematically: e^(at) <br>
