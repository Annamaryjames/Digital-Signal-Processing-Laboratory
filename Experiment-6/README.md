## THEORY<br>
Discrete Fourier Transform is the transformation used to represent the finite duration
frequencies. DFT of a discrete sequence x(n) is obtained by performing sampling operations in
both time domain and frequency domain. It is the frequency domain representation of a discrete
digital signal.<br>
The DFT of a sequence x (n) of length N is given by the following equation,<br>
X(k) = {
$$\sum_{𝑛=0}^{𝑁−1}  𝑥(𝑛)$$ *ⅇxp( −𝑗2𝛱𝑘𝑛/𝑁 );0≤k≤N−1 }<br>
IDFT performs the reverse operation of DFT, to obtain the time domain sequence x(n) from
frequency domain sequence X(k). IDFT of the sequence is given as,<br>
x(n) =1/𝑁
