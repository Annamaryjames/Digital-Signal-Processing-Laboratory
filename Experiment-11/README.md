## THEORY

Sinusoidal are the most smooth signals with no abrupt variation in their amplitude, the amplitude witnesses gradual change with time. Sinusoidal signals can be defined as a periodic signal with waveform as that of a sine wave. The amplitude of sine wave increase from a value of 0 at 0° angle to a maximum value of 1 at 90°, it further reaches its minimum value of -1 at 270° and then return to 0 at 360°. After any angle greater than 360°, the sinusoidal signal repeats the values so we can say that time period of sinusoidal signal is 2π i.e. 360°.If we observe the graph, we can see that the amplitude varying gradually with a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1. We can also observe that the wave begins to repeat its value after a time period or angle value of 2π hence periodicity of sinusoidal signal is 2π. <br>

These are sinusoidal signal parameters:<br>
 • Graph: It is a plot used to depict the relation between quantities. Depending upon the number of variables, we can decide to number of axes each perpendicular to the other.<br>
 • Time period: The period for a signal can be defined as the time taken by a periodic signal to complete one cycle.<br>
 • Amplitude: Amplitude can be defined as the maximum distance between the horizontal axis and the vertical position of any signal. <br>
• Frequency: This can be defined as the number of times a signal oscillates in one second. It can be mathematically defined as the reciprocal of a period. <br>
• Phase: It can be defined as the horizontal position of a waveform in one oscillation. The symbol θ is used to indicate the phase. <br>

If we consider a sinusoidal signal y(t) having an amplitude A, frequency f, and of quantity then we can represent the signal as <br>
         y(𝑡) = 𝐴 𝑠𝑖𝑛(2𝜋𝑓𝑡 + 𝜃)<br>

If we denote 2πf as an angular frequency ω the we can re-write the signal as<br> 
         y(𝑡) = 𝐴 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜔𝑡 + 𝜃 )
