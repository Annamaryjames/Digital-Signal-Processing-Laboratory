## THEORY
The Sampling Theorem, also known as the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, states that a 
continuous signal can be completely reconstructed from its samples if the sampling frequency is greater 
than twice the highest frequency present in the signal. This critical frequency is known as the Nyquist 
rate. <br>
                                                      fs ≥ 2⋅fmax <br>
Where: <br>
fs is the sampling frequency (rate at which the signal is sampled), <br>
fmax is the highest frequency present in the signal.<br> 
Applications: <br>
• Digital audio and video processing <br>
• Communication systems <br>
• Image processing <br>
• Medical imaging<br>
